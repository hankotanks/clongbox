### NOTE
This project is abandoned. My misplaced desire to generalize *everything* with type constraints left the Phonemenomicon/ClongBox codebase a dependency-ridden, complicated mess. For the time being, my dream of an all-in-one conlanging multitool will have to wait. The next time I decide to tackle this project, it will be with strong attention to simplicity.

# ClongBox
1. `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
2. `cargo install --locked trunk`.
3. `trunk serve` to build and serve on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html#dev`
